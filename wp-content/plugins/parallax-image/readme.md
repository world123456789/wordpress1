# Duck Parallax Shortcode

Available on the WordPress Plugin Repository at https://wordpress.org/plugins/parallax-image/

Insert a full width parallax image into your page with this simple shortcode. Parameters allow for setting several key functions like height

## Description

This is a simple parallax image plugin that uses the parallax.js script by pixelcog - http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/ 

To insert your full width parallax image, simply use the [dd-parallax] shortcode.  Include text to be overlaid on the parallax between the open and close [/dd-parallax] code.  This plugin has been tested with Wordpress 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 themes as well as a few themes that use Bootstrap.  I can't guarantee that it will work with all themes, but it's worth a shot.

For example:

```
[dd-parallax img="imagename.jpg" height="600" speed="3" z-index="-100" mobile="mobile-image.jpg" offset="true"] 

Text to be overlaid on the paralllax window

[/dd-parallax]
```

Available parameters for use:

* img - use the filename from the media library for this, not the full path.  Just use imagename.jpg or image.png. (You can also use a fully qualified URL)
* height - This is the height of the parallax window. The unit is in pixels.  Just enter a number
* speed [optional] (default = 2) An integer between 0 and 10.  The speed at which the parallax effect runs. 0 means the image will appear fixed in place, and 10 the image will flow at the same speed as the page content.
* z-index [optional] (defulat = 0) - The z-index value of the fixed-position elements. By default these will be behind everything else on the page.
* mobile [optional] - If you want a mobile fixed image for mobile display, choose a different image, otherwise it will select the full sized image from the parallax and make it a responsive image.
* Offset [default = false] (options: "true" or "false") - This will pull the parallax content all the way to the left of your screen.  You can put the contents into a "container" class if you're using bootstrap or just center the contents for horizontal centering.
* text-pos [optional] - Default is 'top' (to maintain compatibility with ver 1.6).  Available options are "top", "center", "bottom".

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. I'm not seeing the image on the screen, what did I do wrong?

	For this - there are 2 probable reasons that you're not seeing the parallax.
	* First - Check to make sure that your img is only the file name, and not the full path.  If you view the media library in "list" mode yourdomain.com/wp-admin/upload.php?mode=list - there you'll see the filename with the .jpg or .png extension.
	* Second - If not the first answer.  Check your z-index.  Changing the z-index will adjust the layering of your screen with CSS, and may need to be changed depending on how your theme displays the backgrounds and colors.  For more about z-index - [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp)

2. Can I have multiple parallax images on each page. =

	Yes

3. Will this work on mobile devices =

	For mobile devices, you can either have a totally separate mobile image by using the ‘mobile’ parameter in the shortcode, or you can just have the main parallax image resize itself and be responsive.

4. While I’m debugging, the mobile test doesn’t look right = 

	If you’re resizing your browser window to check for responsiveness, the plugin uses mobile_detect, so you must either spoof your user agent, or test on a real mobile device.  You might have to refresh for it to work right.
